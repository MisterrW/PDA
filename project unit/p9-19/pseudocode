This is an example of pseudocode related to my sudoku project.
It describes a way to check if a possible value in a square does not exist in any of the other 8 squares in a given unit (in sudoku, this means that the unique possibility can be set as the square's value).


Function: check if a possible value is unique (unit):
  for every square in the unit,
    for every possible value in that square,
      if that value has not yet been excluded,
        temporarily assume that this value is unique.

        for every other square in the unit under evaluation,
          provided it isn't the square I'm checking against,
            for every possible value in that unit,
              if that value has not yet been excluded,
                if that value is the same as the same as the value in the first square I am checking against,
                  then that value is not unique after all.

        if the previous block did not disprove that the possible value is unique,
          set the square under evaluation's value to the unique possibility.

end function.
